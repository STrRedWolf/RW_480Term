# RW_480Term

A tiny VT-52 write-only serial terminal for the Arduino platform.

## Known hardware

[A Feather M0 Basic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772) attached to a [TFT 3.5" Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3651) or wired to a [3.5" TFT 320x480 + Touchscreen Breakout Board w/MicroSD Socket - HXD8357D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2050).  This imitates an Atari ST style VT-52 with an 80x30 display using IBM CP437 style character set (or Windows 6x8 terminal font).

## VT-52 compatibilty

All known VT-52 codes (and some additions) are in the VT52-RW.md document.  Most are implemented.  See the Changelog for details.\
